# Real-Time-Object-Detection
This Project shows a comprehensive analysis of real-time video object detection models, focusing on prominent architectures such as YOLO(You Only Look Once), MobileNetV2, Faster R-CNN, and EfficientDet D4, among others. With the increasing demand for real-time video analysis in various applications, including autonomous driving, surveillance, and augmented reality, the development of efficient and accurate object detection models has become paramount. We delve into the key concepts and technical underpinnings of each model, exploring their strengths, weaknesses, and trade-offs. We evaluate their performance on benchmark datasets, considering metrics such as accuracy, speed, and memory efficiency. Additionally, we discuss recent advancements, optimizations, and practical deployment considerations for these models.
